### Subscription key

Subscription key is a string that you need to specify as a query string parameter in order to invoke any Face API. The subscription key can be found in My Subscriptions page after you sign in the Microsoft Cognitive Services portal. There will be two keys associated with each subscription: one primary key and one secondary key. Both can be used to invoke API identically. You need to keep the subscription keys secure, and you can regenerate subscription keys at any time from My Subscriptions page as well.
