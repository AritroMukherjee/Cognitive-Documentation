### Acoustic Model

The acoustic model is a classifier that labels short fragments of audio into one of a number of phonemes, or sound units, in a given language. For example, the word “speech” is comprised of four phonemes “s p iy ch”. These classifications are made on the order of 100 times per second

## D

### Deployment

The process through which the adapted custom model becomes a service and exposes a URI

The process of converting “raw” unformatted text back to formatted text, i.e. with capitalization and punctuation, is called inverse text normalization (ITN).

## J

## K

## L

### Language Model

The language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. The language model helps the system decide among sequences of words that sound similar, based on the likelihood of the word sequences themselves

## M

## N

### Normalization

Normalization (Text) : Transformation of resulting text (i.e. transcription) into a standard, unambiguous form readable by the system.

## O

## P

## Q

## R

## S

### Serch and Dictate Model

An acoustic model appropriate for processing commands. The Microsoft Search and Dictation AM is appropriate for speech directed at an application or device, such as such as commands

### Subscription key

Subscription key is a string that you need to specify as a query string parameter in order to invoke any Face API. The subscription key can be found in My Subscriptions page after you sign in the Microsoft Cognitive Services portal. There will be two keys associated with each subscription: one primary key and one secondary key. Both can be used to invoke API identically. You need to keep the subscription keys secure, and you can regenerate subscription keys at any time from My Subscriptions page as well.
