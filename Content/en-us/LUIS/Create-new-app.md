**To create a new app:**

1.	On **My Apps** page, click **New App**.
2.	In the dialog box, name your application "TravelAgent".

3. Choose your application culture (for TravelAgent app, weâ€™ll choose English).
4. Choose a usage scenario, and then click **Next**.
 A usage scenario describes how your LUIS app will be used.
  - **Bot**, if your app will be used as a chat bot.
  - **IOT**, if your app will be used as an IOT app.
  - **Mobile**, if your app will be used as a mobile app.
  
  >  **Note:** The culture cannot be changed once the application is created. 
  
5. In the dialog box below, click the domains that are related to your application, and then click **Create**.

LUIS creates the TravelAgent app and opens its main page which looks like the following screen. Use the navigation links in the left panel to move through your app pages to define data and work on your app. Your first task in the app is to add intents. For more info on how to add intents, see [Add intents](Add-intents.md).
